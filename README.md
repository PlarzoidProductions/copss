Player point management software for Privateer Press' Iron Arena Open Play System

Short:
This software has been designed to track, detect and maintain Achievements earned by players participating in Privateer Press' Iron Arena Organized Play Event Format.  
Long:
Often, at large conventions, several hundred players will participate in the Iron Arena Open Play system.  The Iron Arena system is designed to encourage players to play casual games by rewarding them for earning various achievements.  Some achievements are awarded game-by-game, like playing on special Scenario Tables or playing a new opponent. Others, called “Meta” Achievements in the software, are earned by unlocking a set of other achievements, like playing a game against every faction, or playing against 5 new opponents.
In the past, score sheets were printed by the hundreds, and Press Gangers had to manually sift through these sheets, tabulate achievements and calculate points earned.  This often resulted in long lines of players waiting to report their games, and the occasional missed or miscalculated achievement.
This software aims to replace the paper scoresheet method by detecting, tabulating and awarding achievements automatically.  This allows games to be reported faster, and consistently, resulting in a better experience for both the players and the Press Gangers running the Iron Arena.
